# Multi-instance-learning-CXR

This is my implementation of the paper **LOCALIZATION OF CRITICAL FINDINGS IN CHEST X-RAY WITHOUT LOCAL
ANNOTATIONS USING MULTI-INSTANCE LEARNING** (https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08817)

To run the implenetation on your computer, change `path_name` variable to reflect your path to dataset folder, and run the notebook.
